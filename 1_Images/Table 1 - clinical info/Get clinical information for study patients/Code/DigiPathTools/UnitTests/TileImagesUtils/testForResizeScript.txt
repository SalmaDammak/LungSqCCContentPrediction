--- what I want to check ---
- what is the actual and exact (to many d.p.s) size of the tiles for each slide in microns?
> iRequiredTileSideLength_pixels * resolution_micronsPerPixel
> later down the line, check if this slight inexactness affects results (false positive results)

- did QuPath do the export correctly?
> do the same math as the Groovy code and make sure the output values match
> get the size of a sample tile and make sure it actually sized as the iRequiredTileSideLength_pixels

- Are tiles the correct tile size and resolution?
> Make sure that at the end of the export and resize pipeline, with all its rounding errors, the tile has the right number of pixels and the target resolution
> do this for a tile that
	1) matches the target
	2) is smaller than the target
	3) is larger than the
	4) is very close to the target size

- what resize method looks best for tissue tiles?
- what does an NN resize look like for the labelmaps?
- is the targetTileSideLengthSize_microns consistent for all slides?
